# TitanicMachineLearning
Machine Learning algorithms applied on the Titanic dataset using Python

Following the Machine Learning tutorial from
ogrisel/parallel_ml_tutorial

The "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest" and "Gradient Boosting" classifiers have been applied and comparedusing pandas and scikit-learn in Python to the Titanic dataset.
