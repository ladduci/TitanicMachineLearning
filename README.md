# TitanicMachineLearning
## Machine Learning algorithms applied on the Titanic dataset using Python.

Following the (great) Machine Learning Tutorial from
[ogrisel/parallel_ml_tutorial](https://github.com/ogrisel/parallel_ml_tutorial)

The "Logistic Regression", "Random Forest" and "Gradient Boosting" classifiers have been applied and compared using scikit-learn, and pandas in Python. This is a binary classification problem.
